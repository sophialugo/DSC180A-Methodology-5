### A04: Characterizing Extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer
### Mentor: Vineet Bafna

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The general topic on how cancer is characterized in cells has been the most interesting. The idea of ecDNA is a new concept for me and something I find facinating. It gives me new insight into the unknowness of cancer and why it's a difficult problem to conquer. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation for my quarter 2 project is...

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A change I'd make to the approach taken is to experiement with the images before settling on a project. I think get familiar with the images first would've gave is more ideas as to what could be done and would've made us more familiar with the biology knowledge more quickly by being able to visually see it.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I'm interested in using neural networking and different ML methods to see how their strengths and weaknesses reflect on the images.
